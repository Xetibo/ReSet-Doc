What distribution and version are you using?,0.1.8 pre-release,Arch Linux,"Flatpak, v0.1.5",Ubuntu 23.04,"Arch, flatpak","Arch Linux, native","PopOS 22.04, flatpak",arch,Arch Linux
Did you had any problems installing ReSet?,none,"Installing with cargo resulted in ""/home/REDACTED/.cargo/bin/reset: error while loading shared libraries: libfribidi.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory""",None flatpak worked,'-,no,no,no,no,No
Try to search for a setting and click on a button.,yes,Yes,"Clicking a button works and searching as well, once I could get it to not show the discoverable WiFi networks and devices anymore, I could reproduced it with searching so nothing is found and especially clicking around the Input / Output devices buttons and jumping between sections. Fixed itself after a restart of the complete computer, but not after a restart of the software. Additionally when you search something and find nothing there are some lines that are still intractable below the search bar",Yes,works as expected,yes,the search bar is redundant (as of now),,"Too low contrast, too small, easy to overlook the search field, i would like to see what part of my search string matches with the settings taht i am shown while searching; Icon to delete  text is used in consistently I would expect a round shaped x-button; "
Try resizing the window in different settings,yes,"Yes, however I expected scrolling to scroll down the window instead of changing the volume.",The UI flow works perfectly the only thing the search bar hide is not very smooth. Perhaps making the search bar smaller and then removing it slowly instead of immediately popping out of existence could be better.,"On startup, the selected category is not highlighted in the sidebar. Default category seems arbitrary. Maybe make it a user setting, or an overview of all settings at the same time.","I was not used to Linux, and hence the overall window controls are a bit off, but they are good once known.",yes,"The flow of the pages is a bit unexpected (the same button that moves you to another page, moves you back)",yes,Resizing is used nicely
Try connecting/disconnecting to a WiFi network. Try changing the password as well.,"When entering wrong WLAN passwod the connection does not seem to time out, then while still connecting and trying to change the password the program crashes. (`Err` value: D-Bus error: Did not receive a reply.)","It worked, however I was a bit confused by the apply button always being ""clickable"" even if no settings changed.","Disconnecting and connecting works, but changing the password and changing it back caused the WiFi connection to not work correctly anymore. Connected but not really error message. It showed conencted but there was no actual connection to the internet. Deleting the WiFi and reading with the correct password fixed the issue, restarting did not help. Perhaps some settings were overwriten by mistake.",,IF a connection can't be established an error should be shown,"loading icon missing when connecting, feels like its freezing or bugging.   A button saying -connect- is missing imo.",,"Sometimes the networks didnt appear, but changing their settings was doable without any problems",Feedback to which network i am connected is not sufficient;  think about the pen icon (maybe settings icon better?)
WiFi comments,"Finding new unknown access points sometimes does not work or it takes a long time until they become visible. (under ""Available networks"", `nmcli device wifi list` on the other hand seems to be fast)","I expected clicking on ""WiFi"" again to close the details page.",Overall works well would be nice tough if the connected network could be colord differently as well perhaps the accent color which is used elsewhere for selected buttons or the on state. Could be used to mark the background of connected networks to immediately differentiate between not connected and connected without having to read the small text on the right side,"Machine does not have WiFi. When opening WiFi settings, all other setting become nonfunctional.",,see above,"Without an indicator, I am a bit lost as to whether or not it is connecting, and I might click more than once.",,
Try connecting a Bluetooth device and removing it,"works. Connecting or disconnecting works perfectly. After having connected or disconnected for the first time however, the application needs to be restarted in order to do the inverse.","Connecting worked flawlessly, I didn't test removing since I didn't want to change bluetooth keys.","Turning on and off bluetooth workd as did pairing and discovering but only after those features were enabled once with the KDE UI. Additionly no devices were discoverable even after that, even if they showed on the KDE UI.",,works as expected,,"Work as expected, but the searching needs an indicator",Connection worked smoothly,Why is connected devices at the bottom it is way more interesting than the ones that are available; Tooltips on hover could be nice; 
Bluetooth comments,Progress during connection or disconnection would be useful,"Icons were cool, maybe paired devices should show up different to new ones. It still showed my headphones as connected after I turned off bluetooth. Later, they also didn't show up as connected, even though they were.",Overall nice but no devices to connect too were discoverable even tough there should have been one.,"Machine does not have Bluetooth. Return button for visibility settings says ""Available Networks""",Refresh button is not 100% clear,"when seraching for bluetooth devices, also make a loading icon or something, thanks",,maybe option to hide devices which only display their MAC,
Try changing Volume of your Audio devices,,,"Changing the volume works perfectly, especially the weak stop at 100% is very smooth",'-,works as expected,"no, imo its pretty good",works flawlessly without any explanations needed.,No difficulties encountered,Label needs to go to a differnt position; keyboard input is missing; maybe prevent volume change when muted? Maybe put muting to the right side? Dropdown widgets are strange
Try to change your default Audio device,works,Worked,Changing the default audio device works as expected and is pretty clear,'-,works as expected,"it is convenient, no issues here",works flawlessly without any explanations needed.,Worked after resetting the window,
Try the same with Audio of individual applications,works,Worked,"Changing individual audio works as well. It also works over the 100% threshold, which is very nice because even the KDE UI can not do that",'-,works as expected,"it was all smooth. what impressed me was, that you could play certain applications on a specific bluetooth device, and other applications on other audio connections at the same time. pretty cool",works flawlessly without any explanations needed.,no issues encountered,
Try to disable Audio devices,works,Not sure what is meant by disabling :(,"Disabling the audio device is also intuitive as long as it is not the last audio device, because that one can not be disabled","When setting audio output device profile to off, the app hangs, and audio settings were changed.","profiles is not very clear for naming, but works nice",no issues at all,"ReSet seemed to freeze once, restart solved it",works like a charm,
Input/Output comments,works,,Works well and also shows as expected the running audio streams,,,no issues here,,,
Did you encounter any lags or stutter?,none,,"No stutters or lags have been encountered, besides the WiFi toggle button changing to the left before the color can actually change. Color takes 2 seconds to change where as the button is immedately toggled. Same for other buttons like Bluetooth.",No,,"rarely the program freezes when disabling certain audio devices, it never lagged tho.",No.,,No
Was ReSet intuitive/easy to understand?,"yes, very intuitive ",,"The UI is overall very intuitive and clear, but some smaller improvements can still be made",,"It uses Linux specific naming, but otherwise works fine","yes, imo i would love some more color presets, not just a black and white. but that is personal preference",The structure of ReSet is intuitive.,"very intuitive and easy to understand, nice icons",
Is the layout of the app visually appealing and organized?,yes,,Yes,Submenu navigation is a bit unintuitive (Why is the return button for a submenu completely across the screen),The applications looks nice and clean.,"yes, but i would love some color","Yes, ReSet looks nice and modern.",very appealing,I like the layout visually it looks modern and clean
What features would you suggest to implement next?,Keyboard configuration such as layout,,None fix the existing issues,,,i would love this programm in windows,"Tooltips, and in general status updates for the user",confirm connection to wifis,
"Any other general suggestions, improvements or ideas?",,,None fix the existing issues,Don't show settings that aren't available in the first place. (Say if no bluetooth available),Tooltips and more responses after actions.,"no, just the loading icons, so you know when the programm is working/connecting or doing something",,,
Additional comments,,,Overall very good besides some bugs,"Saved WiFi networks were displayer, even though the machine does not have a WiFi device. When clicking on the edit button, the app craches.",,,,,
