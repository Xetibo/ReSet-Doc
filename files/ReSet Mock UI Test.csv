And the ""Wifi toggle row"" is also a tiny bit wider than for example ""Abailable networks"" rows, which hides the shadow on the right side.  But overall, all of these are just minor things, and otherwise the app was really easy to navigate and consistent and logical in design"

When in parent tab (e.g. Connectivity) a better separation would be good between the child tabs (e.g. wifi & bluetooth), they should probably have a title such as ""WiFi"" and ""Bluetooth"" or a separator element (similar to a HTML <hr> element).

I would suggest assign a header for the navigation bar with content like ""üîç  Reset  ‚ò∞"" with the two icons being buttons. Further is seems that the navigation bar isn't at the top level as is has a margin all the way around.","Yes","Yes","The main part of the application looks quite squashed making it a little confusing to read. Just a a friendly suggestion: you could try using a AdwPreferencesPage for the different settings pages, this should make it look more clean and easier to read.","Yes","No","None","Yes","The navigation and setting pages look very full. I think it would help is more margins would be added between the elements. As I already suggested this might be done using AdwPreferencesPage using Adw*Row as the setting elements. Further is is very confusing that the view has a brake point at which the it gets multi column. Additionally the way the top level navigation elements shows every setting page in this category, I needed a moment to realize that. I suggest that the top level component is a header of the section in the navigation bar, keeping the navigation hierarchy flat. This might also obsolete the bread crumb? And as a little side node: The contrast of the application icon in the AdwAboutWindow is a bit too low in dark mode for my personal preference."
