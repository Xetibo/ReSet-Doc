In this paper, ReSet, a user-friendly settings application for Linux is
developed with the Rust programming language. ReSet aims to run on every
distribution and environment, providing a consistent experience for all users.

Key features include the configuration of Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth devices, and
audio devices. These features are tied together in a responsive user interface.

Future development will focus on new features such as configuring peripherals,
as well as a plugin system. This will allow users to extend ReSet with their
features.

Existing solutions either focus only on one functionality or are tightly coupled
into an already existing environment, which brings incompatible features to
other environments with it. Users of smaller, niche environments are therefore
forced to either use multiple solutions at once or accept a partially
incompatible solution. ReSet focuses on more than one functionality while not
bundling with any environment, making it an independent application and solving
the underlying issue.

In order to provide a consistent, functional and appealing design, multiple
existing solutions were compared and analyzed in order to develop ReSet.

In summary, ReSet represents a significant advancement in Linux settings
applications, offering a concise, cross-environment solution that prioritizes
user experience through Rust's efficiency and adaptability.
