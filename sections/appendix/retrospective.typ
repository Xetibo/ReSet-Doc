#subsection("Retrospective")
In this section, both team members will reflect on their experience in the
project and elaborate on their takeaways.

#subsubsection("Fabio Lenherr")
With this project, I gained a lot of insight into what it means to set your scope
and how it feels when you miss your goal. We originally planned a lot more than
we ultimately achieved, but I feel that we adapted appropriately, and given the
use of proper agile development, it was not a hard decision to take. Still, for
a future project, I will now be better prepared for possible complications with
complexity, as sometimes seemingly simple functionality can suddenly take hours
to fulfill.

The use of Rust, GTK and the general Linux environment was a very welcome
experience, even though it certainly was challenging as well. After this
project, I feel more confident in my abilities in rust, and low-level languages,
given the by now routine usage of the language. I can personally vouch for a
project like this for everyone who wants to try something new or wants to try
out a new language, it might just be a change from whatever you learned before.

In the end, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude for the opportunity to
work on this project within a context that I truly enjoy, even on a personal
level.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the application we created over the last few 
months. While we did plan too much and had to scale down later, it still packs 
many features and more importantly, it was a nice lesson for project planning.

I learned a lot in this project because it involved many tasks that I encountered 
for the first time. This was my first time coming in contact with Rust and GTK. 
Because the language is very different from the languages I have used before and 
the fact that GTK made it a lot more complex, it took some time to get started. 
But generally, it's a nice language I would consider using on different projects.
