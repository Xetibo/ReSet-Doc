#subsection("Risks")
Risks are assessed according to the ISO standard with a risk matrix.

#riskmatrix()
#risk(
  "Toolkit",
  [
    GTK might not be perfectly suitable for our use case, especially considering we
    are using Rust bindings and not C directly.
  ],
  "Medium",
  "Unlikely",
  "Critical",
  [
    Iced can be used as a backup toolkit if GTK turns out to not be usable for the
    project.
  ],
)
#risk(
  "Plugin System",
  [
    The plugin system might be too ambitious and could take too much time to
    realize.
  ],
  "High",
  "Likely",
  "Marginal",
  [
    Instead of a plugin system, dbus[@dbus] or socket connections can be used to
    realize a limited implementation of expected features.
  ],
)
#risk(
  "System Interaction",
  [
    System feature integration like audio, Bluetooth and more might not be as
    seamless as planned.
  ],
  "Low",
  "Rare",
  "Marginal",
  [
    Potential use of alternative integrations.\
    Example: The standard NetworkManager doesn't integrate well â†’ use
    Systemd-networkd instead.
