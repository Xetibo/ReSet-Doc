#subsection("Time Report")
#subsubsection("Sprint 1: Initial Project Planning")
In this sprint, our goal was to build a foundation to work on. This includes
tasks such as creating repositories for our code base and documentation, setting
up time tracking and doing initial research on our topic. Most of our time in
this sprint has been used to write the documentation.

#subsubsection("Sprint 6: Preparation for Midpoint UI Testing")
In this week we tried to get as much UI done as possible, in preparation of the Midpoint UI Test next week. In the daemon, we started working on the Audio settings.

#subsubsection("Sprint 7: Midpoint UI Testing")
Nearing closer to our first UI test, we spent a lot of time on the UI. ReSet was given out to a few people to test. The feedback was used to improve our UI.
