#subsubsection("Sprint 1: Initial Project Planning")
In this sprint, our goal was to build a foundation to work on. This includes
tasks such as creating repositories for our code base and documentation, setting
up time tracking and doing initial research on our topic. Most of our time in
this sprint has been used to write the documentation.
