#subsubsection("Sprint 1: Initial Project Planning")
In this sprint, our goal was to build a foundation to work on. This includes
tasks such as creating repositories for our code base and documentation, setting
up time tracking and doing initial research on our topic. Most of our time in
this sprint has been used to write the documentation.

#subsubsection("Sprint 2: Continuation Initial Project Planning")
In this sprint, we continued working on our documentation. We improved on the UI
section and did some research on various topics.

#subsubsection("Sprint 3: Prototyping and Research")
We have mostly finished all tasks of our project documentation and are now
focusing more on having a first prototype.

#subsubsection("Sprint 4: Start of Implementation")
We have now started working on implementing our prototype. This includes the
communication between ReSet and Reset-Daemon. We also started working on the UI.

#subsubsection("Sprint 5: Continuation of Implementation")
We continued working on the UI. At the same time, the backend was being further
developed.

#subsubsection("Sprint 6: Preparation for Mock UI Testing")
This week we tried to get as much UI done as possible, in preparation for the
Mock UI Test next week. In the daemon, we started working on the Audio
settings.

#subsubsection("Sprint 7: Mock UI Testing")
Nearing closer to our first UI test, we spent a lot of time on the UI. ReSet was
given out to a few people to test. The feedback was used to improve our UI.

#subsubsection("Sprint 8: UI Improvements, Audio and Bluetooth")
We discussed the feedback on our tests and made changes based on it. We also
continued working on Bluetooth as well as Audio.

#subsubsection("Sprint 9: UI Improvements")
We continued working on the UI to make it more responsive, as we still had some
feedback to implement.

#subsubsection("Sprint 10: Wi-Fi and Refactoring")
Now that we are slowly near the end of this project, we started refactoring our
code. We also started implementing the last big feature, which is to set
individual settings for a Wi-Fi network.

#subsubsection("Sprint 11: Bug fixing")
In this sprint, we fixed a lot of bugs in Bluetooth and Audio. The Bluetooth UI
was improved as well, as it lacked some consistency with other UI elements.

#subsubsection("Sprint 12: Bug fixing and documentation")
We continued to squash all the bugs, as we were preparing ReSet for our product
test. We also started working on the documentation.

#subsubsection("Sprint 13: Feedback test and documentation")
This week we prepared the feedback test which additionally tests feedback compared 
to the mock test. We have mostly finished working on ReSet and moved to writing 
the documentation.

#subsubsection("Sprint 14: Final changes to documentation")
We finished the ReSet feedback test and compiled the answers in our documentation. Besides 
that, we fixed and polished the documentation for the final submission.
