*Project Management* | ReSet is managed using Scrum.\
_Due to the small team size, no scrum master or product owner is chosen, the work
of these positions is done in collaboration._\

#subsection("Time")
Because we do not follow the Waterfall methodology, time management further than
around 2 weeks is not very accurate and may change over time. We plan to start working on the program in week 5. Our minimal working UI milestone is in week 7, so we can start doing some UI Reviews and make corrections early enough. By week 12 we should have finished our product and from there, it's just finishing the documentation.
