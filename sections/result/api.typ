#subsection("IPC API")
As explained in @Architecture, inter-process communication is handled via DBus,
in this section, all exposed DBus functions and events are documented.

A full, versioned version can be found on TODO link.

#subsubsection("DBus Types")
In order to properly understand the DBus API, the following table will provide
information about DBus types and how they correspond to the regular rust types.
