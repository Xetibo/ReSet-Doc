    - inspired by windows and gnome monitor settings 
      - some environments do not have this feature (text based)
    - drag and drop instead of input fields/text file config
    - specific settings not set in stone yet
    ```)

    - Highlight of top 4 layouts
      - Change CSS dynamically is hard
        - No signals to bind to
      - Solution: Using custom actions to change CSS
    - Grouped layouts
      - Nested groups -> ListBox always selecting a row
        - Always selecting back row, which triggers an action
      - Some rows have different logic depending on if variant exists
      - Solution: Grab focus so no selection is triggered
    - Flatpak Sandboxing
      - GIO cannot access the system schemas 
      - Solution: Use flatpak-spawn to spawn commands outside of sandbox
    - Main problems:
      - Bad documentation and no examples
      - Very static
